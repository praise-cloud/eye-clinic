# 🏥 Visual Field Test Management App (Refined Version)

## 🔹 Who Uses It

1. **Doctors**

   * Review test results.
   * Compare patient history.
   * Generate reports.
   * Chat with clinic assistant.

2. **Clinic Assistants**

   * Register patients.
   * Upload/fetch test results from the machine.
   * Send updates or clarifications to the doctor via chat.

---

## 🔹 Core Features

### 1. **Authentication**

* Login for Doctor or Assistant.
* Simple roles: `doctor` and `assistant`.

---

### 2. **Dashboard (Sidebar Navigation)**

* **Home** → Quick overview (patients today, total patients, tests done).
* **Patients** → Register/search/view patients.
* **Tests/Results** → Upload and view visual field test results.
* **Reports** → Generate/export PDF reports.
* **Chat** → Secure doctor ↔ assistant communication.
* **Settings** → Backup/restore database.

---

### 3. **Patient Management**

* Add/edit/delete patients.

* Link multiple tests to one patient.

---

### 4. **Test Management**

* Assistant uploads or fetches results from the visual field machine.
* Results stored in SQLite and linked to a patient.
* Doctor views results in graphs/tables.

---

### 5. **Reports**

* Doctor generates a PDF with test summary + interpretation.
* Stored in DB + downloadable for hospital records.

---

### 6. **Chat System**

* Simple internal chat between **doctor and assistant**.
* Local storage only (not internet-based).
* Example flow:

  * Assistant: “Patient ID 123 results uploaded.”
  * Doctor: “Reviewed, please call patient in.”
* Could be implemented with a **chat table in SQLite**.

---

### 7. **Data Management**

* Local SQLite database for everything (patients, tests, chat, reports).
* Backup & restore option (so hospital IT can save/restore data easily).

---

## 🔹 Database Schema (Refined)

```sql

## 🔹 Development Phases

### **Phase 1 (MVP)**

* User roles (doctor, assistant).
* Patient registration.
* Upload/view test results.
* Local SQLite database.

### **Phase 2**

* Chat system.
* Report generation (PDF).
* Backup/restore database.

### **Phase 3**

* Better UI/UX (charts, search filters).
* Data migration/export option.
* Optional cloud sync (later).

---

✅ So the **big difference** now:

* No appointment/booking system.
* Add a **chat feature** for doctor ↔ assistant.

Do you want me to **draw up a screen-by-screen wireframe** (like a sidebar layout with “Home | Patients | Tests | Reports | Chat | Settings”) so you can actually see how the workflow should look before you start coding in Electron?
# Recommended Tech Stack (summary)

* Desktop shell: **Electron** (packaging: `electron-builder` or `electron-forge`)
* Frontend/UI: **React** (Vite or CRA) + **Tailwind CSS** or **MUI (Material UI)**
* State: **Zustand** (small) or **Redux Toolkit** (if you want formal structure)
* Forms & validation: **React Hook Form** + **Zod**
* Charts (visual field graphs): **Chart.js** or **Recharts**
* Local DB (MVP): **SQLite** (file-based) + **Prisma ORM** (type-safe & easy migration)
* DB driver: `better-sqlite3` (fast + synchronous) or `sqlite3` (async)
* Backend logic (inside app): **Node.js** within Electron main process (no separate server required)
* IPC / Security: `contextBridge`, `ipcMain.handle`, `ipcRenderer.invoke` (no `nodeIntegration`)
* File watching: **chokidar** (monitor exported files folder)
* Serial/USB comms (if needed): **serialport** (for RS-232/COM)
* DICOM: run **Orthanc** (local DICOM server) or use JS libs like **dcmjs**/`dicom-parser` for parsing if needed
* PDF generation/export: **Puppeteer** (render React page → PDF) or **PDFKit** for programmatic PDFs
* Logging & errors: **winston** or **pino** (local log files); optional Sentry for remote errors
* Password hashing: **argon2** or **bcrypt**
* Packaging: **electron-builder** (produces installers: .exe/.msi/.dmg/.AppImage) or **electron-forge** (easier dev)
* Dev tooling: **pnpm** or **yarn** (monorepo-friendly), **ESLint**, **Prettier**, **TypeScript** (strongly recommended)

# Why these choices (short reasons)

* **Electron + React**: reuses your web knowledge, fast to develop, cross-platform.
* **SQLite + Prisma**: SQLite is perfect for a single-PC clinical app; Prisma makes switching to PostgreSQL later painless.
* **chokidar + serialport**: covers both common machine export methods (file export vs serial comm).
* **Preload + contextBridge**: secures native access; prevents remote code execution risk.
* **Puppeteer**: lets you create nicely styled, print-ready PDFs from your existing React components.

# Key libraries & specific roles

* `electron` — app shell
* `electron-builder` / `electron-forge` — packaging
* `react`, `react-dom`, `vite` or `create-react-app` — UI
* `tailwindcss` or `@mui/material` — styling
* `prisma` + `@prisma/client` — ORM for SQLite and later Postgres
* `better-sqlite3` (or `sqlite3`) — DB driver (if you prefer direct driver)
* `chokidar` — watch folder for new exported files from machine
* `serialport` — talk to RS-232/USB ports (if machine uses serial)
* `dcmjs` / `dicom-parser` or **Orthanc** — DICOM parsing / server
* `react-hook-form`, `zod` — forms & validation
* `chart.js` / `recharts` — visualization
* `pdfkit` or `puppeteer` — PDF export
* `winston` / `pino` — logging
* `argon2` — password hashing
* `playwright` / `jest` + `react-testing-library` — testing (end-to-end + unit)

```

* **main**: handle DB access, file watchers, serial comms, DICOM calls, backup/restore.
* **preload**: expose explicit safe APIs (e.g., `clinicAPI.getPatient(id)`, `clinicAPI.importTestFromFile(path)`).
* **renderer**: purely UI — calls `window.clinicAPI.*` methods only.

# Security & data rules (must-haves)

* `contextIsolation: true`, `nodeIntegration: false` for BrowserWindow.
* Only expose minimal APIs via `contextBridge` — no direct Node in renderer.
* Hash passwords with **argon2**; never store plaintext.
* Encrypt sensitive fields at rest if required (e.g., patient identifiers) — use Node `crypto` (optional).
* Secure backups: allow only authenticated admins to export DB; prefer encrypted export.
* Audit/log: log imports and user actions (who imported which test and when).

# Database design notes (SQLite → later PostgreSQL)

* Use **Prisma** with SQLite for dev & initial release:

  * `prisma.schema` supports both SQLite and PostgreSQL — switching DB later is straightforward.
* Keep tests’ raw data as JSON or a BLOB file reference (store files on disk, save path in DB).
* Add a `migrated_at` and `source_system_id` columns to track legacy data origin.

# Visual field machine integration patterns

1. **File export** (most common): machine drops files into a network/shared folder

   * Use `chokidar` in main to monitor folder; parse file; create test record; notify UI via IPC.
2. **DICOM push**: run **Orthanc** locally and configure machine to send to it; have main poll Orthanc or listen to webhooks.
3. **Serial / TCP**: use `serialport` or TCP sockets in main to receive data in real-time; parse and persist.
4. **Manual upload**: assistant uploads file from UI via file input → file saved to app storage + DB.

# Backup, restore & migration strategy

* Backup: copy SQLite `.db` file to chosen path or zip+encrypt and allow manual export.
* Restore: provide UI to import `.db` snapshot (validate schema version).
* Legacy `.bak` (MS SQL) → restore in SQL Server Express → export CSV / SQL → import with scripts into SQLite. (You already discussed this.)
* Migration to server: create a migration script that exports new records (or full dump) and POSTs to server API (once server side exists).

# Dev workflow & scripts (example)

* Use a monorepo or single repo with `concurrently` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "concurrently \"vite\" \"electron:dev\"",
  "build:renderer": "vite build",
  "build:electron": "electron-builder",
  "start": "electron .",
  "migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
  "generate": "prisma generate"
}
```

# Testing & QA

* Unit: `jest` + `ts-jest` for Node and shared utilities.
* UI: `react-testing-library`.
* End-to-end: **Playwright** with Electron capabilities to automate UI and simulate file imports.
* Manual: test machine integrations on real hardware early.

# Required developer skills / team checklist

* JS: React + Node (main + renderer separation)
* Electron: windows lifecycle, packaging, preload & IPC patterns
* Backend & DB: Prisma / SQL, migrations, schema design
* Machine integration: familiarity with serial comms, file watchers, DICOM basics (depending on the machine)
* UI: React, CSS (Tailwind or MUI), charting libraries
* Security: password hashing, data encryption basics
* DevOps: packaging installers and basic distribution

# Hardware / environment needs

* Dev machine: Windows (since clinic will likely run on Windows) — test on target OS
* Access to the visual field machine or its sample export files (CSV/XML/DICOM) early in development
* If machine uses RS-232, a USB-RS232 adapter for dev testing
